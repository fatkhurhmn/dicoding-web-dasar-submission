              Hello, my name is Muhammad Fatkhu Rohman, I live in a rural area
              in Karanganyar Solo. Now I'm still studying at Diponegoro
              University, majoring in Informatics. I really like programming and
              design. I think learning programming is fun because it sharpens
              the brain to solve a problem. Likewise with design, it helps the
              brain to think creatively and bring out all that it has. Sometimes
              when I have free time I also do sports, such as football,
              badminton, cycling, and others. Exercise makes the body healthier
              and less susceptible to disease. One day I want to be an android
              developer, besides that I also have a dream to set up a startup.

          <div class="description">

            <p>
              After graduating from high school, I continued my education in
              college. Alhamdulillah, I passed the SBMPTN selection and entered
              the Department of Informatics, Diponegoro University. Since high
              school I really wanted to go into this major because I like
              programming. Now that I am in semester 6, I have studied many
              subjects and applied them. One of my interests is Android
              Application Development. Since semester 4 I started learning
              android programming, until I joined the IDCamp scholarship and I
              choose the Android learning path. In this 6th semester I also took
              part in the Studi Independen program from the Kampus Merdeka. The
              program I choose was Bangkit Academy, which offers 3 study paths
              and I choose the Android learning path as well.

                These are just a few of the many experiences I've had,

                <h4>Organization</h4>
                <p>
                  While I was in college, I often took part in extra-academic
                  activities. Until now, I am still a member of the Vice Manager
                  of the media division at UKM R'nB, Dipnegoro University. This
                  is my second year at UKM R'nB. Here I learned a lot about
                  business and research. In addition, here also learn to do
                  community service. I have also been in the Information Media
                  Office division at IMAKA Undip, the organization that oversees
                  all students at Diponegoro University who are from
                  Karanganyar. And many more.

                <h4>Internship</h4>
                <p>
                  Internship is an activity that must be done by every student.
                  Especially students who have entered the third year. I myself
                  have participated in an internship program organized by the
                  Faculty of Science and Mathematics in collaboration with PT
                  Rekayasa Agromarin Indonesia. The position I took was Mobile
                  Developer. Here I get the task to create a mobile application
                  that is useful for calculating water quality. And I was very
                  lucky to participate in this internship, because apart from
                  getting an internship experience for the first time, I also
                  had the opportunity to visit Karimunjawa which is the research
                  center in this internship activity.
